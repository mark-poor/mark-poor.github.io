I am an H.C. Wang Assistant Professor at Cornell University. Previously I had been an IASH postdoc at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem hosted by Saharon Shelah.
My research focuses primarily on mathematical logic  and its connections with other areas of mathematics, most notably with set theory, algebra, combinatorics, measure theory and descriptive set theory.
