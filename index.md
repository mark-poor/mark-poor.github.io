I am an H.C. Wang Assistant Professor at Cornell University. I had completed my PhD at Eötvös University, Budapest, under the supervision of M. Elekes in 2021, after which I was an IASH postdoc at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem hosted by Saharon Shelah.
My research focuses primarily on mathematical logic  and its connections with other areas of mathematics, most notably with set theory, algebra, combinatorics, measure theory and descriptive set theory.
